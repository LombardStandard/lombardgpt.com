  "about-section-1": "Buying and selling investment-grade Commercial Real Estate (CRE) is a complex legacy business where things have been done the same way for centuries: personal relationships. Then, over the last 3 decades, software technology disrupted the process with wide adoption of digital spreadsheets (early '90s) and online CRE marketplaces (around year 2000), providing a new inflow of opportunities. However, despite the long-proven business model, CRE marketplaces never thrived outside the United States.",
  "about-section-2": "In Europe or Asia Pacific, there is no unified set of rules, nor a common language and, interestingly enough, confidentiality is still considered a very important value for a deal, no matter how big. So there are no comprehensive platforms, but just local versions with limited  adoption and functionalities. The result is that the majority of CRE buyers or sellers worldwide still relies on relationships and spreadsheets to find a match, producing inefficiencies and siloes that it's time to solve.",
  "about-section-3": "<strong>Technology.</strong> The availability of Artificial Intelligence provides to any enterprise a level of computational power unimaginable just a few months ago. It's now possible to leverage AI/ML algorithms at scale and with low costs. LombardGPT analyzes thousands of websites using Large Language Models (LLMs) and is able to match CRE sellers and buyers across any asset class and global markets.",
  "about-section-4": "<strong>Team. </strong>We are a group of passionate individuals based in Asia driven by a sharp focus on real estate digitalization. We are equipped with diversity, expertise, and a humble grit to push our vision. We are challenging the most traditional and hard-to-evolve of all industries.

This Agreement covers all Beta Products made available to Customer by Lombard, including, without limitation, any Beta Products specifically identified by Lombard as being in 'Beta' or any similar stage of development. Lombard retains sole and absolute discretion as to which, if any, Beta Products will be made available to Customer during the Term.

If mediation fails to resolve the dispute, either party may file an action at the Tokyo District Court only and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of the applicable courts. The laws of Japan govern this Agreement. The prevailing party in any litigation may seek to recover its legal fees and costs. Any breach of confidentiality obligations in this Agreement, or any unauthorized use of the services or a partyâs intellectual property by the other, may cause irreparable harm. In no event may this agreement be governed by the United Nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods.",
  "terms-section-15": "<strong>Compliance with Laws and Legal Advice.</strong> Each party must comply with all laws, rule or regulations applicable to such partyâs activities in relation to this Agreement, including export control laws of the United States which are applicable to the application or service and which may prohibit use of the application or service in certain sanctioned or embargoed countries. Lombard will not provide Customer with any legal advice regarding compliance with data privacy or other relevant laws, rules or regulations in the jurisdictions in which Customer uses the Beta Product(s) ('Laws'). The parties acknowledge and agree that not all features, functions and capabilities of the Beta Product(s) may be used in all jurisdictions and Customer recognizes that certain features, functions and capabilities may need to be configured differently or not used in certain jurisdictions in order to comply with applicable local Laws, and in certain jurisdictions consents may need to be obtained from individuals submitting data via the Beta Product(s) as to the intended purpose, storage, distribution, access and use of the data submitted ('Local Use Decisions'). Customer is responsible for Local Use Decisions and Lombard disclaims all liability for Local Use Decisions.",
  "terms-section-16": "<strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This Agreement does not create a partnership, agency relationship, or joint venture between the parties.

If this Agreement is translated into a language other than English, the translation is for convenience only, and the English language version will govern. If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, that provision will be modified to render it enforceable to the extent possible to affect the partiesâ intention and the remaining provisions will not be affected. Failure of Lombard to enforce a right under this Agreement shall not act as a waiver of that right or the ability to later assert that right relative to the particular situation involved. This Agreement includes any schedules and exhibits attached hereto. Such documents encompass the entire agreement between Customer and Lombard with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior representations, agreements and understandings, written or oral. This Agreement may only be altered, amended or modified by duly executed written instrument. You may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Lombard. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement shall be binding upon the parties and their respective administrators, successors and assigns.",
